**Setting up git**

**Step 1:** Fork Summit-App to GitHub Account

1. Go to GitHub of Summit-App
2. Click &quot;Fork&quot; on the top right to add the repo to your repos
3. Go to your Summit-App forked repo



**Step 2:** Local Clone of Forked Summit-App

1. Click &quot;Clone&quot; and copy the URL
2. Open Terminal and cd to where you want to have the repo on your computer
3. Type: git clone \&lt;URL\&gt;
4. cd to the Summit-App repo

**Step 3:** Configure local fork with upstream develop

1. Go to [https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App](https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App)
2. Click &quot;Clone or download&quot;
3. Copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Go back to terminal (make sure you are in your repo)
  1. To confirm you&#39;re in your local repo type: pwd
  2. Expected Result: &quot;\&lt;PATH\&gt;/Summit-App
5. Type: git remote -v
  1. Expected result:
origin  [https://github.com/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/%3cUSERNAME%3e/Summit-App.git) (fetch)
origin  [https://github.com/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/%3cUSERNAME%3e/Summit-App.git) (push)
6. Type: git remote add upstream \&lt;URL\_FROM\_STEP\_2\&gt;
7. Type: get remove -v
  1. Expected result:
origin  [https://github.com/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/%3cUSERNAME%3e/Summit-App.git) (fetch)
origin  [https://github.com/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/%3cUSERNAME%3e/Summit-App.git) (push)
upstream         [https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App.git) (fetch)
upstream         [https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App.git](https://github.com/SummitApp/Summit-App.git) (push)

Let me explain what you how have set up:

So, we have our SummitApp/Summit-App repo that has a master and a develop branch, and in step 1 you forked this repo to your GitHub account. This makes a copy of the repo for you in your account. In step 2 we cloned our fork to our local computer, which allows you to get/add anything found in the fork on your computer with pull/push. The last, and most confusing aspect is step 3, this is where we configure our local repo to pull from our SummitApp/Summit-App repo â€“ which we will refer to as &quot;upstream&quot;. This is because while you are working on a specific feature on your local fork, somebody else might have added code to the &quot;upstream develop&quot; branch (this is where we will have all of our development code that people have decided to be finished). You might be asking yourself &quot;why do this?&quot;. The answer to this is simple: we don&#39;t want one specific person to be able to break our upstream develop branch, which will be our &quot;stable&quot; codebase. This does make you have to do extra steps when trying to get your code from upstream develop. Now I will go through how to actually use this setup to develop code for specific features, push code to your fork and also get your feature code into the develop branch.

**Using Git**

Let&#39;s say I want to create a feature called &quot;sample-feature&quot;, these will be the following operations that you will do to both set up the feature, but also do continuous development on said feature.
